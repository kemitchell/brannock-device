## Arch Length

Some anthropometry papers used the following formulas to convert Brannock sizes to millimeters:

- Foot Length in mm = 187 + (25.4 / 3) * (D1 - 0.5)

  - D1 is the Brannock foot length in Brannock units
  - 187 ≅ 7⅓ inches × 25.4 mm per inch, the Brannock size offset
  - (25.4 / 3) = ⅓″ = 1 barleycorn, the Brannock size gradation

- Foot Width in mm = 64.3 + 3.2 × (D2 - 1)

- Arch Length in mm = 173.5 + 5.6 × (D3 - 7)
  - D3 is the arch length in Brannock units
  - (14 / 64) × 25.4 ≅ [rounded] 5.6 mm
